- For step 1, I used a while loop because the best way to run a program until the number is less than or equal to 1 would be a while loop. My solution works by finding whether the numbers are even or odd and either diving them by two or multiplying them by three and adding one to the number and entering it into the sequence until the number reaches 1 or below. Then it counts each time it repeats the loop each time and prints it.
- For step 2, I used a for loop because I needed to go through every number in between 2 and the input number and for loops would be the easiest way to iterate through it. My solution works by first checking the special composite numbers which are 1 and 0 and then the special prime number 2. Then in the for loop, it checks from 2 to the input number for if the number is prime or not by checking if the number is divisible by 2.
- For step 3, I used for loops because I needed to print numbers from 1 through 10 and I used a nested for loop to print the rows and columns and change each row by the multiple number. My solution works by first printing the starting numbers because it doesn't have the same amount of numbers to print than the other rows and gives the rest of the rows starting numbers to multiply by.
- I used Google Gemini to help me solve the whitespace issue I was having in step 1 by explaining to me what methods I could do to achieve the same outcome.
